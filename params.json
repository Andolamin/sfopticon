{"name":"SfOpticon","tagline":"In your Salesforce controlling your versions","body":"SfOpticon is a tool to add software conifguration managment capabilities to the Salesforce development cycle. \r\n\r\n### Getting SfOpticon\r\nThe source for SfOpticon can be downloaded on this website as a zip archive, or a gzipped tarball. However, if you would always like to be up to date, it is recommended that you clone the git repository. \r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/sfopticon/sfopticon.git\r\n```\r\nFor more information, or for even more download methods, please visit https://github.com/sfopticon/sfopticon\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nConfiguration details are stored in the 'application.yml' file. Please fill out your database and scm details here. Currently, MySQL and Github are the only supported configurations.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nInstallation is simple and requires [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [bundler](http://bundler.io/) \r\n```\r\n$ cd sfopticon/\r\n$ bundle install\r\n```\r\nIf installation fails, it is most likely due to missing database drivers. Please see the troubleshooting section for more details.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nFirst, a production environment must be setup.\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/ennironment.rb create --name <YOUR_PROD_ENV_NAME> --production\r\n```\r\nAfter you have created your production environment, feel free to create other non-production environments as you see fit.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to create a changeset using the scanner tool. You can do this manually, but it is recommended to create a relatively frequent (~20 - 30 minutes) cron job for this. As its name implies, the scanner tool scans your environment for changes and synchronizes them with the remote SCM system.\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/scanner.rb changeset --org <ENVIRONMENT_TO_SCAN>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, the integration tool allows you to integrate branches, and then deploy the merged changes to any environment.\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/integrate.rb merge --soruce <SOURCE_ENV> --destination <DEST_ENV>\r\n```\r\nThis will perform the merge and stash your changes in a temporary branch, allowing you to deploy at your leisure. \r\n\r\n// TO-DO INSERT DEPLOY DOCUMENTATION HERE WHEN THE FEATURE IS DONE\r\n\r\n### Troubleshooting\r\n// TO-DO Get all deb or rpm or osx or windows dependenceis outside of the normal ruby things\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRyan Parr - @ryanparr \r\nJosh Arenson - @josharenson\r\nMatthew Roark - @matthew-roark\r\nDeb Weller","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
